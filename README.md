A discord theme which makes the guild and user sidebars collapsible. You can edit which ones are enabled, if they display as an overlay or not and the speed of the transitions.
`collapse.theme.css` is the file needed to apply the theme.

The channels sidebar only works with the old UI, which is now impossible to revert to. If you're looking for this feature with the new UI, then I recommend using something like [this](https://discord.com/channels/1015060230222131221/1028106818368589824/1354606015819022416) from the Vencord server.
