A discord theme which makes the sidebars (guilds, channels, users) collapsible. You can edit which ones are enabled, if they display as an overlay or not, the speed of the transitions, and the size of the channels sidebar.
`collapse.theme.css` is the file needed to apply the theme.

The channels sidebar currently only works with the old UI, which can be re-enabled with experiments. If you're looking for this feature with the new UI, then I recommend using something like [this](https://discord.com/channels/1015060230222131221/1028106818368589824/1354606015819022416) from the Vencord server.
